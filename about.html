        <h2>Barn Owl Lifestyle</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px">Barn Owls are often found in open and partly open country including grasslands, marshes, and agricultural areas. They are often around human habitation. They are cavity-nesting birds that use natural as well as human-created cavities. Preferred man-made structures include large platforms within barns and silos, tunnels dug into silage in roofed or topless silos, and barn cupola shelves.</p>
